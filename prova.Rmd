## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
cars <- rbind(cars, cars[1:3, ])
summary(cars)
```

La media di `cars` è `r mean(cars$speed)` e la numerosità campionaria è `r nrow(cars)`.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\frac{a}{b}$ printing of the R code that generated the plot.

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \epsilon_i
$$

```{r}
kable(cars) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars)
tab_model(fit)
```
